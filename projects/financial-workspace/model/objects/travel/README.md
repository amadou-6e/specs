## Owned concepts

Journey, Travel segment, Booking, Travel stay.

## Boundaries

This domain owns system-independent financial meaning. Provider identity and presentation belong to system models, cross-system aliases to mappings, and execution steps to processes.

## Maturity

Status is **draft**. Implemented coverage varies by process; unsupported fields remain unknown rather than inferred.
